## brief outline
1. Problem description of vertex enumeration
  - What are use cases for this?
2. different approaches to vertex enumeration
3. Simplex algorithm (just quick overview and what it eventually does)
  - Maybe recycle some slides from last presentation
4. Actual algorithm
  - How it works
  - What it does
  - Why does it work?
5. What are improvements and work that has started from this approach?
